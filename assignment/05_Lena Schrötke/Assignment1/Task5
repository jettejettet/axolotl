# Task 5:
# Write a Python program that asks the user to input the lengths of the sides in a triangle and outputs
# whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. The program should also check for the Triangle
# inequality (𝑧 < 𝑥 + 𝑦), and prompt the user for a valid input.

a = float(input("Length of side a of a triangle: "))
b = float(input("Length of side b of a triangle: "))
c = float(input("Length of side c of a triangle: "))

if c < a + b:
    print("This is not a valid triangle. Please use a valid input: ")
elif a == b == c:
    print("Your triangle is equilateral.")
elif a == b or b == c or c == a:
    print("Your triangle is isosceles.")
else:
    print("Your triangle is scalene.")
