# Task 6:
# Write a program that reads a non-negative integer number in the decimal representation provided by the
# user and prints the octal representation of the number. For example, if the user enters 167, the output should be 247.

while True:
    number = int(input("Please enter a non-negative number: "))
    if number < 0:
        print("This number is not valid. Please enter a non-negative number.")
    else:
        break

# print the octal number and don't show the 0o
print(oct(number)[2:])

# Write a more general program that reads in a non-negative number (potentially including decimal places)
# in the decimal representation provided by the user and prints the octal representation of the number.
# For example, if the user enters 25.11, the output should be 31.0702436560507534.
