# Task 3:
# Write a program that reads an upper bound (number) provided by the user and prints the sequence Fibonacci
# numbers that are less or equal to the number given by the user. Use a loop for this task.
# The Fibonacci sequence is defined as Fn = Fn-1. Use F0 = 0 and F1 = 1 as seed values.

upperBound = int(input("Please insert a number: "))

F0 = 0
F1 = 1
fibonacci = 1

if upperBound == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(0)
    while fibonacci <= upperBound:
        print(fibonacci)
        fibonacci = F0 + F1
        F0 = F1
        F1 = fibonacci
